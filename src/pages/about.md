> ## I am a passionate front-end developer and ui/uxdesigner with a keen eye for details.


A story of hardwork and perseverance.

Hi! I'm Pulkit Singh. I have a strong passion for design and technology. I specialize in Front End Development and UI/UX Design and my passion is all about building elegant and professional user interfaces and websites. I also do branding and identity design such as logo design, letterhead and business card, along with photo editing, image cropping and other graphic design services.

I live in the Delhi, India. I am a graduate of Information Technology from ABES Institute of Technology, AKTU. I started drawing and designing from a young age and most of my design skills and knowledge are self-taught. I got into programming when I was introduced to web programming during high school. It fascinated me and it hooked me on, so I decided to pursue this career. Even though I took the path of becoming a programmer, my strong and innate talent in arts and design persisted. Consequently, I taught myself about software design patterns. Combining the state of the art and my programming knowledge, I am able to build a professional and interactive websites.

I will not stick around on just doing Front End development projects. My goal is to take it to the next level of becoming a Full Stack Developer and become one of the world's top designers, so now, I am working towards it. I have prepared myself to accept the challenges into this ever changing world and I will try my very best to achieve my dreams and goals.



## **Personal Experience**

<!--StartFragment-->

Starting out at the age of 13 I never stopped learning new programming skills and languages. Early I started creating websites for friends and just for fun as well. Besides web development I also explored Python and other non-web-only languages like C# with Unity3D. This passion has since lasted and lead to my decision of working as a freelance web developer and consultant. The success and fun I have in this job is immense and really keeps that passion burningly alive.
