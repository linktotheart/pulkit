###### What is **Gridsome**?

Gridsome is a *Static-Site-Generator* for **Vue.JS,** which is heavily inspired by [Gatsby and Nuxt.JS](https://pulkits.netlify.app/blog/gatsbyjs-vs-nuxtjs-which-is-better-what-should-you-choose-for-your-next-project/). Websites made with Gridsome are fast by default as they are Vue powered SPA's, and data layer is handled by *GraphQL*, which is a great and very easy tool to collect data almost from anywhere like WordPress, Any API's, .md files, or even Google Spreadsheet and turn them into static sites.
