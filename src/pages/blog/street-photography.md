[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a popular framework of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). If you are a Vue.js developer, you have probably heard of Nuxt.js, but you might not know what this framework is about.

You are probably asking questions like:

* What’s the idea behind Nuxt.js?
* What type of applications is Nuxt.js used for?
* What are the benefits of Nuxt.js?
* Why do I need a framework for a framework?

In this blog post, we are going to cover all these queries and try to answer all these questions in an elaborative way.

# ***What Is Nuxt.js?***

Nuxt.js is a high-level framework that is built using Vue. It simplifies web app development of single-page or universal Vue.js apps. This Vue.js framework abstracts away the details of server and client code distribution so that you can focus only on web application development.

The goal of this framework is for it to be flexible enough for website developersto use as the main project base.

As most of what Nuxt.js does happens during the web **app development** phase, you get a lot of features with only a few extra KBs added to your JS files.

Let us explore the reasons why you might need Nuxt for your next **web development** project.

# ***How Nuxt.js Works***

When a user visits a Nuxt.js web app or navigates to one of its web pages via `<nuxt-link>`, here is what happens:

1. When the user initially visits the web application, if the`nuxtServerInit`action is clearly defined in the store, Nuxt.js will call this and update the store.
2. Nuxt.js executes any existing middleware for the web page visited. It checks the `nuxt.config.js `file in the first place for global middleware, then checks the matching layout file for that requested page, and, finally, checks the web page and its children for middleware. Middleware is prioritized in that particular order.
3. If that particular route that’s visited is a dynamic route, and a `validate() `method exists for it, the route is clearly validated.
4. Then, Nuxt.js calls the`fetch() `and `asyncData() `methods to load data before rendering the page. The `asyncData()`method is widely used for fetching data and rendering it server-side, while the `fetch()`method is widely used to fill the store before rendering the web page.
5. At the final step, the page containing proper data is rendered.

# Benefits of Nuxt.js

## ***1. Create universal web apps without the hassle***

One of the biggest advantages of Nuxt.js is that it helps in creating universal apps easier.

What is a universal app?

A universal web app is used to describe the JS code that can execute both on the server’s side and the client’s side.

Many advanced JS frameworks, like Vue, are aimed at creating single-page applications, also called*SPAs*. There are a plethora of benefits to having an SPA over a traditional website.

For instance, you can build very snappy user interfaces that update quite fast. But SPAs also come with some disadvantages like long load times, and Google struggles with these sites because there is no content initially on the page to crawl for search engine optimization purposes. All of the content is generated with JS after the fact.

A universal web app is about having a single-page application, but instead of having a blank`index.html`page, you are preloading the web application on a server and sending rendered HTML as the response to a browser request for every route to speed up load times and improve search engine optimization by making it easier for Google to crawl the web page.

Nuxt.js immensely helps you write universal web apps more simply.

Creating universal web applications can be a tedious task because you have to do a plethora of configuration on both the client-side and server-side.

This is the problem Nuxt.js aims at solving for Vue applications. Nuxt.js makes it pretty simple to share the same code between the server and the client so you can focus on your web application’s logic.

Nuxt.js also gives you[access to various properties](https://nuxtjs.org/api/context/)like`isClient`and`isServer`on your components so you can easily decide if you are rendering something on the server or on the client.

There are also special components like the[no-SSR component](https://nuxtjs.org/api/components-no-ssr/)which is widely used to purposely prevent the component from rendering on the server-side.

In the last, Nuxt.js gives you access to an `asyncData `method inside of various components that you can use to fetch data and render it on server-side programming.

Now, that is the tip of the iceberg of how Nuxt.js helps you with creating universal web applications. You can learn more about what Nuxt offers for rendering universal web applications from its [user guide](https://nuxtjs.org/guide).

## ***2. Statically render your Vue apps and get all of the benefits of a universal app without a server***

One of the biggest innovations of Nuxt.js comes with its `nuxt generate `command. This command generates a static version of the web app. It’ll generate HTML for every one of the routes and puts it inside of its own file.

For instance, if you have the below-mentioned pages (Nuxt’s term for routes):

Nuxt will generate the following folder structure:

The benefits of doing this are quite similar to the advantages of universal web applications. There is markup there to make loading the page faster and to help social media crawlers and search engines crawl the website.

The difference is that you do not need a server anymore. Everything is generated during the web development phase.

It is powerful as you get the benefits of universal rendering without the need for a server. You can just host your web app on Amazon S3 and GitHub Pages.

You can read more about this in the static generated section of the docs of Nuxt.js.

## **3. Get automatic code-splitting**

Nuxt.js can easily generate a stable version of your website with a special [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration.

For each route (page) that is statistically generated, the route gets its own JavaScript file also, with just the code needed to run that particular route. This can help with speed because it keeps the size of the JS file small, relative to the size of your entire web application.

## 4. Setup via the command-line with the starter template

Nuxt.js also provides a starter template which is called a *starter-template* that gives you all the scaffolding needed to get started with a project, with a good structure of folders for organization.

Make sure you have [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) installed, and run the following command:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/618/1*kwIXP3IQjePfZW3rjXk0DQ.png)

From there, just `cd `into the web application and run `npm install `and you should carry this further.

## **5. Get great project structure by default**

In many small Vue.js web applications, you end up managing the code structure as best you can in different files.

The default Nuxt web application structure provides you with a great starting point for organizing your web application in an understandable manner.

Here are some directories that it sets you up with:

* Components — A folder so that you can organize your Vue.js components individually.
* Layouts — A folder to contain your main web application layouts.
* Pages — A folder to contain your web app’s routes. Nuxt reads all the Vue files inside this directory and builds the web application router.
* Store — A folder to contain all of your app’s Vuex store files.

## ***6. Set up with an auto-updating server for easy development***

As compared to setting up this process by yourself or the change-refresh process that web **app developers** are used to, creating it with Nuxt is a breeze. It sets up with an auto-updating development server.

While you are developing and working on those few `.vue `files, Nuxt.js uses a webpack configuration to check for all the changes and compiles everything for you.

In addition to this, you can run the command `npm run dev`i nside of a Nuxt project and it’ll set up the web development server.
